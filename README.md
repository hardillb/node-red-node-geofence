Geofence node for Node-RED

This uses the geolib node to check if points fall with in a given area. Points are 
taken from msg.location.lat & msg.location.lon

Areas can be circular or rectangular.

Messages can be filtered depending on if they fall inside or outside the given area

The config node uses leaflet and openstreetmap data so requires internet access. 
You can drop back to a non graphical config by replacing geofence.html with 
geofence-nomap.html

The message.locations is augmented by a property called `shapes` which contains shapes of
geofence nodes the message traverses when nodes are in `add « inarea » property` action mode.

There is a flow-level property called `shapes` which contains all shapes defined in all geofence nodes
in a flow as long as they are hit by a message. (I.e., nodes that are not hit by at least a message will not see their shapes added.)

The following piece of code transforms and sends geofence shapes to a node-red-contrib-web-worldmap node for display (flow level shapes).
It is possible to change shape stroke and fill. See node-red-contrib-web-worldmap for details.

Nodes must have a name. Shapes have the name of their respective nodes.

```
var shapes = flow.get('shapes');

if(shapes) {
    Object.keys(shapes).forEach(function(key,index) {
        msg.payload = {};
        msg.payload.name = key;
        if(shapes[key].points) {
            msg.payload.area = [];
            for(var i = 0; i < shapes[key].points.length; i++) {
                msg.payload.area.push([shapes[key].points[i].latitude, shapes[key].points[i].longitude])
            }
        } else if(shapes[key].radius) {
            msg.payload.radius = shapes[key].radius;
            msg.payload.lat = shapes[key].centre.latitude;
            msg.payload.lon = shapes[key].centre.longitude;
        }
        node.send(msg);
    });
}
```
